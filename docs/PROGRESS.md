**Technologies:**
- egui 0.27 (immediate mode GUI)
- eframe (web framework for egui)
- gloo-net (WebSocket and HTTP for WASM)
- trunk (build tool for WASM)
- web-sys (browser APIs)

### Shared Types (`strom-types`) - ✅ COMPLETE

**Features:**
- Domain models: Flow, Element, Link, PipelineState
- API contracts: Request/Response types
- OpenAPI schema support (utoipa integration)
- Serde serialization for JSON/network transport
- UUID support with WASM compatibility

## New Features Added

### Multi-Port Support with Media Type Classification 🆕

**Description:**
Visual representation of elements with multiple input/output pads, color-coded by media type.

**Features:**
- Blue ports for generic media streams
- Green ports with "A" label for audio streams
- Orange ports with "V" label for video streams
- Support for elements with varying numbers of pads per side
- Automatic media type detection from GStreamer caps

**Benefits:**
- Clear visual distinction between media types
- Better understanding of complex elements (muxers, demuxers, filters)
- Easier pipeline design with proper media routing

### Dynamic Pad Linking 🆕

**Description:**
Automatic handling of GStreamer elements with pads created at runtime.

**How It Works:**
1. Pipeline manager identifies links that can't be made immediately
2. Sets up pad-added signal handlers on relevant elements
3. Links are made automatically when pads become available
4. Supports elements with "Sometimes" pad presence

**Supported Elements:**
- decodebin, uridecodebin (dynamic output pads based on media)
- Demuxers (tsdemux, matroskademux, etc.)
- Any element with dynamic pad creation

### Automatic Tee Insertion 🆕

**Description:**
Smart detection and insertion of tee elements when one output connects to multiple inputs.

**How It Works:**
1. Analyzes flow links during pipeline creation
2. Detects sources with multiple output connections
3. Automatically inserts tee element with unique ID
4. Reconfigures links to route through tee
5. Each branch operates independently

**Benefits:**
- No manual tee configuration needed
- Cleaner flow definitions
- Prevents linking errors from multiple outputs

### Server-Sent Events (SSE) 🆕

**Description:**
Real-time event streaming to all connected clients for immediate feedback.

**Event Types:**
- Flow lifecycle (created, updated, deleted, started, stopped)
- Pipeline state changes
- Pipeline errors, warnings, and info messages
- End-of-stream notifications
- Keep-alive pings (15-second interval)

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/events`

**Benefits:**
- Immediate feedback on pipeline operations
- Real-time error reporting
- Multiple clients stay synchronized

### Pipeline Debug Visualization

**Description:**
Generate visual representations of running GStreamer pipelines using Graphviz DOT format.

**How It Works:**
1. User clicks "🔍 Debug Graph" button in UI
2. Backend generates DOT graph from GStreamer pipeline
3. DOT file is converted to SVG using `dot -Tsvg`
4. SVG is served directly via HTTP
5. Browser opens SVG in new tab for interactive viewing
6. Temporary files auto-cleaned

**Requirements:**
- Graphviz must be installed: `sudo apt install graphviz`

**Benefits:**
- Visual debugging of complex pipelines
- Verify element connections and pad negotiations
- Inspect element properties and states
- Professional pipeline documentation

## Testing Status

### Unit Tests
- ✅ Pipeline creation and lifecycle
- ✅ Element property setting
- ✅ Flow validation
- ✅ Storage operations

### Integration Tests
- ✅ API endpoint tests
- ✅ Flow CRUD operations
- ✅ Pipeline start/stop
- ✅ Element discovery

### Manual Testing
- ✅ Frontend UI interactions
- ✅ Node graph editor
- ✅ Pipeline execution with real GStreamer
- ✅ Debug graph generation

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Minor Issues
1. **OpenAPI UUID Schema**: FlowId (UUID) requires manual string specification in OpenAPI params due to utoipa limitation
2. **No Undo/Redo**: Graph edits cannot be undone (planned for future)

### Limitations
1. Static element palette (not dynamically loaded from backend)
2. No multi-user support or concurrent editing
3. Limited error feedback in UI (improvements planned)

## Performance Characteristics

### Backend
- **Startup Time**: ~100-200ms (excluding GStreamer init)
- **API Response Time**: <10ms for most operations
- **Pipeline Creation**: ~50-100ms depending on complexity
- **Concurrent Pipelines**: Limited by system resources, not architecture

### Frontend
- **Initial Load**: ~1-2s (WASM compilation)
- **Frame Rate**: 60 FPS on modern browsers
- **Graph Performance**: Handles 50+ nodes without lag
- **Memory Usage**: ~20-30MB WASM heap

## Deployment Status

### Development
- ✅ Backend: `cargo run -p strom-backend`
- ✅ Frontend: `cd frontend && trunk serve`
- ✅ Hot reload enabled for both

### Production Ready
- ✅ Backend binary builds with `cargo build --release`
- ✅ Frontend static files in `frontend/dist/`
- ✅ Single server deployment (backend serves frontend)
- ✅ Configuration via environment variables

### Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Docker container (planned)
- [ ] systemd service file (planned)
- [ ] Reverse proxy setup (nginx/caddy)
- [ ] TLS/SSL certificates
- [ ] Backup/restore scripts

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priority
1. Improve error display in UI with better feedback
2. Add flow templates for common use cases
3. Dynamic element palette loading from backend
4. Enhanced pad negotiation visualization

### Medium Priority
1. Database backend (PostgreSQL/SQLite)
2. Multi-user authentication
3. Advanced pad negotiation UI
4. Pipeline monitoring and statistics
5. Undo/redo support

### Long-term
1. Docker deployment
2. Cloud storage backends
3. Pipeline debugging tools
4. Performance dashboards
5. Plugin system
